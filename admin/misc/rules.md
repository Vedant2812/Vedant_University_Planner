# Team Rules
Revised October 15, 2022

## Psychological Safety

- Honesty : We would be honest about the work we have done / are doing.
- Safe Space : The group meetings/slack are a safe space for everyone where everyone's ideas are welcome and heard equally without any hesitation.
- Equal Opportunity : Members are expected to share their actual opinion, and have it evaluated equally, even if it conflicts with others.

## Commitment

- As most of the deadlines are on Sunday, Our team will target a Friday deadline with a hard deadline for Saturday afternoon.
- We would use AGILE development technique.
- We would spend at least minimum time on the project, expected â‰¥ 1 hour.
- We would adhere to the deadline and reach out if we are stuck somewhere.

## Conflict

- We would try to understand the both person's point and situation in cases where we feel the person is not working.
- If this still continues, we would have a neutral party (Leaders, Allison) in the meeting to discuss the issue.
- We would try to support one another as much as possible, working towards compromises.

## We would be using github issues for Issue tracking

## Task List

- We would break larger tasks into smaller, manageable tasks.
- We would have a meeting on Monday for setting up the expectations and tasks for the week.
- We would have a mid-week status check on Wednesday, it is expected something has been started.
- The Scrum master would ensure to follow up on any impediments.
- We would have daily standups where you report what you expect to work on (even if it is "nothing").
